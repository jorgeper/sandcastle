// Parallel Planner with Review — re-entrant orchestration loop
//
// Each iteration:
//   Phase 0 (Classify):  Deterministic code inspects GitHub state for every
//                        open `Sandcastle` issue and picks an action:
//                          implement | merge | resolve-conflicts |
//                          addresser-turn | reviewer-turn | wait | abandoned
//   Phase 0.5 (Merge):   Approved PRs (owner approval + zero unresolved
//                        threads) are squash-merged — code, no agent.
//   Phase 0.6 (Rebase):  Approved-but-conflicting PRs get a conflict-resolver
//                        agent, then merge on the next pass.
//   Phase 0.7 (Debate):  PRs awaiting an agent turn resume the outer
//                        reviewer ⇄ addresser debate in PR review threads.
//   Phase 1 (Plan):      An opus agent picks unblocked issues among those
//                        with no open PR (dependency analysis).
//   Phase 2 (Execute):   Per issue: a spec writer distills the issue into a
//                        committed spec (specs/issue-<n>.md, linked from the
//                        issue) and a goal statement; the implementer then
//                        runs in goal mode — Claude Code's native /goal turn
//                        loop self-verifies each attempt, with fresh-context
//                        retries between attempts (see ADR 0021). Issues
//                        labeled `sandcastle:require-pr` then publish a PR and
//                        enter the debate; others keep the legacy inner
//                        reviewer.
//   Phase 3 (Merge):     Legacy branches merge locally via the merger agent.
//
// Issues opt in via labels: `sandcastle` queues an issue for the loop;
// `sandcastle:require-pr` gates it behind a PR. Run `npm run sandcastle:init`
// once per repo to create the label vocabulary. Everything runs as the
// owner's single identity (see PR_SETUP.md): agents mark their comments with
// **[agent-name]** prefixes, and the merge gate is the owner adding the
// `sandcastle:approved` label — GitHub approvals are not used, since authors
// cannot approve their own PRs.
//
// Usage:
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts              run the loop
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts --init       create the label vocabulary
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts --doctor     check env/auth/docker/labels
//   npx tsx .sandcastle/main.mts --help       show usage
